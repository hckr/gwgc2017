# gwgc2017
The goal was to make a game for [Gynvael's Winter GameDev Challenge 2017](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=668).
However I didn't come up with an idea so there isn't much done â€“ just "a build toolchain" to compress and bundle everythink in one file. That "everything" is a page with canvas and a menu in HTML with transition effects and music playing in background. You can see it [here](https://hckr.github.io/gwgc2017/). Some interesting (and not) things I found out during the development can be found [here](DIARY.md).

## How to run
`index.html` should be served with a HTTP server, otherwise it would not work in Chrome(/ium).
In Firefox everything is just fine.
